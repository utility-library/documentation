## <p style="color: #0071ff;">About</p>
The utility library was created to facilitate and speed up the writing and debugging process for ESX based FiveM servers.

Contains the most redundant and verbose processes to make them easier, such as ESX initialization which turns into `StartESX()`.

I started writing this library for personal use, and then once i understood the great usefulness and optimization of resources i decided to make it public to facilitate the work of those new to this world and those who are already there, with the hope of being able to collect suggestions, integrate new features and make it one of the reference libraries.
