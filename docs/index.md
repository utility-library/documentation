# Welcome

Welcome to the **Utility Library** documentation; here you can found **everything** about the utility.
<br>
---
## <p style="color: #0071ff;">Why?</p>
Utility serves to reduce and simplify the long and tedious processes of creating a script.
Take for example the initialization of ESX which translates to StartESX().

I developed this library for my own use, but only once I realized the great help and the great simplification of many steps, i decided to publish it to facilitate the work of newbies and veterans, hoping to receive suggestions and support to integrate new features that bring the library to be always updated and useful.

## Implementation in other script
In order to use the Utility you need to load it via the `fxmanifest.lua`

???+ info "Client"
    The normal one is:
    ```
    '@utility_lib/client/native.lua',
    ```
    You can also use the minimized version via:
    ```
    '@utility_lib/client/native_min.lua',
    ```
???+ info "Server"
    The normal one is:
    ```
    '@utility_lib/server/native.lua',
    ```
    You can also use the minimized version via:
    ```
    '@utility_lib/server/native_min.lua',
    ```
